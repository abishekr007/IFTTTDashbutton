# IFTTTDashbutton

This Project is a multipurpose dash button which is designed to carter to the needs of blind and physically disabled people. The principle working of this button is somewhat similar to Amazon's Dash Button. It can perform numerous number of tasks with just a press of a button. We can order a pizza, book an Uber, control IoT appliances, use it to open a smart door lock, and also use it as a panic button. Since the code doesn't change with different tasks there is no need to reprogram it everytime, we just have to select the task in the app and its good to go.
